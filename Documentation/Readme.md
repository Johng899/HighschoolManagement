# High School Management System Documentation

Welcome to the High School Management System Documentation repository! This repository contains detailed documentation for the High School Management System project, aimed at modernizing administrative processes within Ethiopian high schools.

## Introduction

Education plays a crucial role in shaping the future of individuals and societies. In Ethiopia, high schools have traditionally managed their operations manually, leading to challenges in maintaining student information, organizing schedules, and facilitating effective communication among stakeholders. The High School Management System project addresses these challenges by introducing a digital platform to streamline administrative tasks and improve communication within high schools.
